# WizardGame
A platformer where you play as a Wizard that collects fruit, casts spells and chases fairies as you try to avoid the Frog King and his loyal guard.
This game was originally created for a University module on game physics and simulations, but I enjoyed working on it and am continuing to work on it for fun.
